* Run transient analysis. Ensure the stop time is long enough
* for the oscillator to reach steady state.

* Measure the period and frequency after the oscillator has stabilized.
* These commands are processed after the transient analysis finishes.

* This block runs after the simulation and measurement.
* It can be used to plot results or print the measured values.
